                    <h2>What are the origins of the NACUBO Student Success Hub?</h2>
                    <p>The Hub was born out of a multi-year grant-funded initiative launced in 2021 to explore how chief business officers (CBOs) can champion equitable student success through financial leadership. NACUBO Formed a Networked Improvement Community (NIC) of 26 institutions to test and refine a model of practice for student-centered strategic finance. </p>
                    <p>These institutions-diverse in size, mission, and student population-collaborated to identify barriers, test innovation, and share inshigts. Their contribution directly informed the development of the Hub's tools and recourses.</p>
